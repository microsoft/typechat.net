# TypeChat.NET

TypeChat.NET is an **experimental project** that makes it easy to build natural language interfaces using strong Types. 

TypeChat.NET applies the ideas of [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat) to .NET. 

        // Translates user intent into strongly typed Calendar Actions
        var translator = new JsonTranslator<CalendarActions>(
            new CompletionService(Config.LoadOpenAI()),
            new TypeValidator<CalendarActions>()
        );

TypeChat.NET consists of the following assemblies:
* TypeChat: Translate user intent into strongly typed and validated objects
* TypeChat.Schema: Classes for exporting .NET types as Typescript schema. 
* TypeChat.Program: Classes to synthesize, validate and execute ***JSON programs*** 
* TypeChat.SemanticKernel: Integration with Microsoft Semantic Kernel. 
* TypeChat.Dialog: Classes for working with interactive Agents
* TypeChat.App: Classes and extensions used by Typechat examples; may also be useful for other apps built using Typechat

TypeChat.NET is in **active and rapid development** with very frequent updates and refactoring. 
- **Goal**: learn how to strong typing programming with AI, particulary generative LLMs. 
- Supported scenarios are shown in the examples. Complicated schemas with generics may not work (yet). 
- Local performance may not be optimal (yet). Fortunately, most code will spend almost all of its time calling the AI.
- When in doubt, look at the code. Comments and documentation will improve as the code settles. 


## TypeChat ##
Brings TypeChat to .NET.
- Json Translators
- Json Validators

The library is a port of the TypeChat Typescript library with .NET idiom introduced as needed. 

## TypeChat.Schema ##
The library provides exporters for .NET Types to Typescript schema. 

Includes support for dynamic export at runtime, including with ***each request*** to the AI. This is needed for scenarios where the schema must include dynamic lists, such as relevant product names or lists of players in a team.

## TypeChat.Program ##
TypeChat.Program translates natural language requests into simple programs (***Plans***), represented as JSON. TypeChat.Program includes:
- Program Translator: translates user intent into programs that follow the [Program Grammar](src/typechat.program/ProgramSchema.ts)
- Program Interpreter: Executes programs generated by ProgramTranslator using an interpreter.
- Program Compiler: uses the dynamic language runtime (DLR) to compile programs/plans into verifiable typesafe code that can be checked for errors... and ***repaired***. 
- Program C# Transpiler/Compiler (experimental): Transpile programs into C# and compile them into typesafe assemblies with Roslyn. Compilation diagnostics can be used to repair programs.  

## TypeChat.SemanticKernel ##
TypeChat.SemanticKernel makes it easy to get ***strongly typed*** .NET objects from the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel).

With auto-generation of Typescript schema:

        // Translates user input into a typed responses classifying sentiment
        var translator = new JsonTranslator<SentimentResponse>(
            new LanguageModel(Config.LoadOpenAI()),
            new TypeValidator<SentimentResponse>()
        );

TypeChat.SemanticKernel also contains experimental support to dynamically synthesize and execute **programs** that call Semantic Kernel plugins. 

The library contains classes for:
* LLM bindings for TypeChat using the Semantic Kernel. All TypeChat examples use the Semantic Kernel to call LLMs
* Program synthesis with Plugins: Automatically turns registered plugins into a PluginAPI that programs synthesized by the LLM can call. [Plugins Example](examples/Plugins/Program.cs)

# Getting Started 
## Building
You will need Visual Studio 2022. VS Code is not tested. 
* Load **typechat.sln** from the root directory of your . 
* Restore packages
* Build

## Examples

To see TypeChat in action, we recommend exploring the [TypeChat example projects](./examples). 

### Api Key
- You will need to provide an **Open API key**
- Go to the ***examples*** folder in the solution
- Create appSettings.Development.json
- Add your Api Key

### Inputs
- Each example includes an **input.txt** with sample input. 
- Pass the input file as an argument to run the example in **batch mode**.
