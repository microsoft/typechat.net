# TypeChat.NET

TypeChat.NET is an experimental project from the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) team. TypeChat.NET brings the ideas of [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat) to .NET. 

TypeChat.NET helps you build natural language interfaces with LLMs using strong types and type-safe programs. 

        // Translates user intent into strongly typed Calendar Actions
        var translator = new JsonTranslator<CalendarActions>(
            new LanguageModel(Config.LoadOpenAI())
        );

**Goal**: develop frameworks that enable strongly typed programming with AI. Currently supported scenarios are shown in the examples. 

TypeChat.NET is in **active development** with frequent updates. When in doubt, look at the code. Comments and documentation will improve as the code settles. 


# Assemblies
TypeChat.NET consists of the following assemblies:
* **TypeChat**: Classes (JsonTranslator<T>) that translate user intent into strongly typed and validated objects. Additionally includes:
  * Support for automatically exporting .NET type information as schema expressed using the concise syntax of Typescript. This schema is sent to language models. 
  * Validation of returned JSON. 

* **TypeChat.Program**: Classes to synthesize, validate and run  ***JSON programs*** 

* **TypeChat.SemanticKernel**: Integration with Microsoft Semantic Kernel - access to language models, support for Semantic Kernel Plugins, Embeddings and Semantic Memory

* **TypeChat.Dialog** (Early): Classes for working with interactive Agents

* **TypeChat.App**: Useful support classes and extensions used by Typechat examples, such as Text Classifiers. These may also be useful for other apps built using Typechat


## TypeChat ##
Brings TypeChat to .NET with .NET idiom introduced as appropriate.
- Json Translators
- Json Validators
- Schema: exporters for .NET Types to schema expressed using Typescript. 

Schema export includes support for:
* Dynamic export at runtime, including with ***each request*** to the AI. This is needed for scenarios where the schema must include dynamic lists, such as relevant product names or lists of players in a team.
* Vocabularies: easy unions of string tables, like in Typescript, along with support for dynamic loading. See examples: CoffeeShop and CoffeeShop2.

## TypeChat.Program ##
TypeChat.Program translates natural language requests into simple programs (***Plans***), represented as JSON. These programs are then type checked, compiled and run with type safety.
TypeChat.Program includes:
- Program Translator: translates user intent into programs that follow the [Program Grammar](src/typechat.program/ProgramSchema.ts)
- Program Interpreter: Executes programs generated by ProgramTranslator using an interpreter.
- Program Compiler: uses the dynamic language runtime (DLR) to compile programs/plans into verifiable typesafe code that can be checked for errors... and ***repaired***. 
- Program C# Transpiler/Compiler (experimental): Transpile programs into C# and compile them into typesafe assemblies with Roslyn. Compilation diagnostics can be used to repair programs.  

        // Translates user intent into typed Programs that call
        // methods on a Math API
        _api = new MathAPI();
        _translator = new ProgramTranslator<IMathAPI>(
            new LanguageModel(Config.LoadOpenAI()),
            _api
        );
 
## TypeChat.SemanticKernel ##

The library contains classes for:
* LLM bindings for TypeChat using the Semantic Kernel. All TypeChat examples use the Semantic Kernel to call LLMs
* **Program synthesis with Plugins**: Automatically turns registered plugins into a PluginAPI that programs synthesized by the LLM can call. [Plugins Example](examples/Plugins/Program.cs)
 
# TypeChat.Dialog
TypeChat.Dialog is an early version of framework desiged for strongly typed interactions with Agents with built in interaction history and other features. 

    // Create an agent that interactively helps the user enter their health information, such as medications and conditions
    new Agent<HealthDataResponse>(new LanguageModel(Config.LoadOpenAI()))

# TypeChat.App
Helper classes for:
* Console Apps
* Text Classification
* Intent dispatch and routing
* Generation and validation of programs that use Plugins

# Getting Started 
## Building
You will need Visual Studio 2022. VS Code is not tested. 
* Load **typechat.sln** from the root directory of your . 
* Restore packages
* Build

## Examples

To see TypeChat in action, we recommend exploring the [TypeChat example projects](./examples). 

We sugggest exploring examples in this order:
* To learn about Typechat and JsonTranslator: 
  * Sentiment: the simplest example that demonstrates JsonTranslator and other core features 
  * CoffeeShop
  * Calendar
* To learn about TypeChat.Program and program synthesis
  * Math
  * Plugins (program synthesis that target Semantic Kernel Plugins)

### Api Key
- You will need to provide an **Open API key**
- Go to the ***examples*** folder in the solution
- Create appSettings.Development.json
- Add your Api Key

### Inputs
- Each example includes an **input.txt** with sample input. 
- Pass the input file as an argument to run the example in **batch mode**.
