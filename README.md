# TypeChat.NET

TypeChat.NET is a project from the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) team. TypeChat.NET brings the ideas of [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat) to .NET. 

TypeChat.NET helps you build natural language interfaces with LLMs using strong types and type-safe programs. 


        // Translates user intent into strongly typed Calendar Actions
        var translator = new JsonTranslator<CalendarActions>(
            new CompletionService(Config.LoadOpenAI()),
            new TypeValidator<CalendarActions>()
        );

**Project Goal**: develop frameworks that enable strongly typed programming with AI. Currently supported scenarios are shown in the examples. TypeChat.NET is in **active and rapid development** with frequent updates and refactoring. When in doubt, look at the code. Comments and documentation will improve as the code settles. 


# Assemblies
TypeChat.NET consists of the following assemblies:
* **TypeChat**: Translate user intent into strongly typed and validated objects
 
* **TypeChat.Schema**: Classes for automatic exporting .NET types as Typescript schema. This schema is then sent to the AI. Also includes additional support for validating the returned JSON. 

* **TypeChat.Program**: Classes to synthesize, validate and execute ***JSON programs*** 

* **TypeChat.SemanticKernel**: Integration with Microsoft Semantic Kernel - access to language models, support for Semantic Kernel Plugins, Embeddings and Semantic Memory

* **TypeChat.Dialog** (Early): Classes for working with interactive Agents

* **TypeChat.App**: Useful support classes and extensions used by Typechat examples; may also be useful for other apps built using Typechat


## TypeChat ##
Brings TypeChat to .NET with .NET idiom introduced as appropriate.
- Json Translators
- Json Validators

## TypeChat.Schema ##
The library provides exporters for .NET Types to schema expressed using Typescript. 

Includes support for:
* Dynamic export at runtime, including with ***each request*** to the AI. This is needed for scenarios where the schema must include dynamic lists, such as relevant product names or lists of players in a team.
* Vocabularies: easy unions of string tables, like in Typescript, along with support for dynamic loading. See examples: CoffeeShop and CoffeeShop2.

## TypeChat.Program ##
TypeChat.Program translates natural language requests into simple programs (***Plans***), represented as JSON. TypeChat.Program includes:
- Program Translator: translates user intent into programs that follow the [Program Grammar](src/typechat.program/ProgramSchema.ts)
- Program Interpreter: Executes programs generated by ProgramTranslator using an interpreter.
- Program Compiler: uses the dynamic language runtime (DLR) to compile programs/plans into verifiable typesafe code that can be checked for errors... and ***repaired***. 
- Program C# Transpiler/Compiler (experimental): Transpile programs into C# and compile them into typesafe assemblies with Roslyn. Compilation diagnostics can be used to repair programs.  

## TypeChat.SemanticKernel ##
TypeChat.SemanticKernel makes it easy to get ***strongly typed*** .NET objects from the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel).

With auto-generation of Typescript schema:

        // Translates user input into a typed responses classifying sentiment
        var translator = new JsonTranslator<SentimentResponse>(
            new LanguageModel(Config.LoadOpenAI()),
            new TypeValidator<SentimentResponse>()
        );

TypeChat.SemanticKernel also contains experimental support to dynamically synthesize and execute **programs** that call Semantic Kernel plugins. 

The library contains classes for:
* LLM bindings for TypeChat using the Semantic Kernel. All TypeChat examples use the Semantic Kernel to call LLMs
* Program synthesis with Plugins: Automatically turns registered plugins into a PluginAPI that programs synthesized by the LLM can call. [Plugins Example](examples/Plugins/Program.cs)

# Getting Started 
## Building
You will need Visual Studio 2022. VS Code is not tested. 
* Load **typechat.sln** from the root directory of your . 
* Restore packages
* Build

## Examples

To see TypeChat in action, we recommend exploring the [TypeChat example projects](./examples). 

### Api Key
- You will need to provide an **Open API key**
- Go to the ***examples*** folder in the solution
- Create appSettings.Development.json
- Add your Api Key

### Inputs
- Each example includes an **input.txt** with sample input. 
- Pass the input file as an argument to run the example in **batch mode**.
