# Calendar

The Calendar example shows how you can capture user intent as a sequence of actions, such as adding event to a calendar or searching for an event as defined by the [`CalendarActions`](CalendarActionsSchema.cs) type.

# Usage

Example prompts can be found in [`input.txt`](input.txt).

For example, we could use natural language to describe an event coming up soon:

**Input**:

```
I need to get my tires changed from 12:00 to 2:00 pm on Friday March 15, 2024
```
