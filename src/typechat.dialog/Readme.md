# TypeChat.Dialog
TypeChat.Dialog is an **early** version of a framework that demonstrates how TypeChat.NET may be used for strongly typed interactions with message passing Agents or Bots. These agents can include features such as built in interaction history. 

TypeChat.Dialog includes classes and interfaces for:
* Agents
* Messages and message history.
* Collecting relevant context that remains within character/token limits.
