# About TypeChat.Program

**TypeChat.Program** is an experimental library that translates natural language requests into simple programs (***Plans***), represented as JSON. These programs are then type checked, compiled and run with type safety.

TypeChat.Program builds on the ideas of [TypeChat](http://github.com/microsoft/typechat.net).

TypeChat.Program includes:
- Program Translator: translates user intent into programs that follow the [Program Grammar](src/typechat.program/ProgramSchema.ts)
- Program Interpreter: Executes programs generated by ProgramTranslator using an interpreter.
- Program Compiler: uses the dynamic language runtime (DLR) to compile programs/plans into verifiable typesafe code that can be checked for errors... and ***repaired***. 
- Program C# Transpiler/Compiler: Transpile programs into C# and compile them into typesafe assemblies with Roslyn. Compilation diagnostics can be used to repair programs.
