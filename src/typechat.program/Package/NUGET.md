# Microsoft.TypeChat.Program

**Microsoft.TypeChat.Program** is an experimental library that translates natural language requests into simple programs (***Plans***), represented as JSON. These programs are then type checked, compiled and run with type safety.

TypeChat.Program builds on the ideas of [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/typechat).

TypeChat.Program includes:
* Program Translator: translates user intent into programs that follow the [Program Grammar](src/typechat.program/ProgramSchema.ts)
* Program Interpreter: runs programs generated by ProgramTranslator using an interpreter.
* Program Compiler: uses the dynamic language runtime (DLR) to compile programs/plans with type checking. Compilation diagnostics are used to repair programs. 
* Program C# Transpiler/Compiler (experimental): transpiles programs into C# and compile them into assemblies. Compilation diagnostics are used to repair programs.
